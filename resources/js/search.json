There are different types of codecs, each with its own compression algorithms and characteristics. Lossless codecs preserve the original quality of the data during compression and decompression, while lossy codecs achieve higher compression ratios by discarding certain information that is considered less important or perceptually less noticeable. Generally, a codec on its own does not determine the quality.","Bitrate","Refers to the amount of data that is processed or transmitted per unit of time. Higher bitrates generally produce higher-quality audio or video, but they also require more storage space and bandwidth for transmission. However, it's worth noting that the relationship between bitrate and quality is not always linear. Factors like the codec, compression algorithm, resolution, and content complexity also play significant roles in determining the perceived quality.","Transparency","Transparency is a term used to describe the perceived quality of a lossy file.

Databases like thetvdb use S00EXX for specials while databases like MAL simply use the episode name for specials.","A common thing in anime releases is Specials/OVAs numbered as 0.5, e.g. Anime Name - 18.5. This is not recommended at all.","0.5 Episodes are not supported by a single piece of software or database but they usually make it easier for the person watching to know where it chronologically lands in the show. You may or may not include this in the filename.","S00EXX isn't very user friendly, because it doesn't really tell much on its own but it guarantees automatic parsing and correct identification. You must include this in the filename. Refer to thetvdb to find this for your episode.","Including the Episode title is highly recommended in this case as it makes identification significantly easier and understandable for anyone who downloads it. Neither S00EXX or 0.5 provides this information at a glance which is why the episode title is really helpful in this case. Refer to either thetvdb or MAL to find the episode name.","You may include the absolute number of the episode as long as it's not a decimal episode that lands between any two existing ones. Optional and really just down to preference. It's much better than decimal episode numbering but still not ideal.","This means we need a name that is easily readable, parsable, and identifiable. This is achieved by using a combo of the above.","This is an example of a well named special episode. Anime Name tells us the name of the anime, S00E04 tells us the episode number in the SXXEXX standard which makes it easily identifiable, and Title of the Episode makes it significantly more human readable.","Another good example, this tells us the name of the anime, where it lands chronologically, what episode it is with reference to databases and the name of the episode to aid with identifying the episode without much effort."]},{"l":"More Examples","p":["Bad, do not use:","Good names:"]},{"l":"Folder","p":["Must contain Season information in the format: S0X or Season X.","Make one folder for each Season following all the guidelines.

Do not use subfolders like NC, Creditless, etc.","Ideally, you should upload specials/OVAs separately if they have their own entry on AnimeBytes/AniDB. If you still insist on grouping them with the main entry, you must put them in a subfolder called Specials. This is because S00 is alphabetically above any other season, so a naive user might click the first file and end up watching the wrong episode. Furthermore, grouping them this way will lead to unnecessary complications when someone (even you) cross-posts it to a tracker that enforces proper boundaries between entries (which includes virtually every private tracker).","Anime that are a single season split between two cours, e.g. Eighty-Six aired in two cours, cour 1 and cour 2, but is a single season, must be named in a way that satisfies both which is achieved by adding the episode range after the season info ( S0X).
