# Installation
## Windows
1. Grab the topmost file from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files/64bit/).
    - *Note: If you don't want to setup MPV yourself, you can grab this pre-configured [MPV portable build](https://mega.nz/folder/11QCTZgR#sdsjUYkIieGjVR09mnpYSw) with the same settings as described in this guide. All you need to do is download it and follow these installation instructions.*
2. Extract it into a folder.
    - *Note: This folder cannot be changed after installation. If you want to change it after installation, you'll have to uninstall and then reinstall it in the new location.*
3. Navigate to the `installer` folder.
4. Inside the `installer` folder you'll find `mpv-install.bat`, run this as an administrator.
    - *If you want to read about what `mpv-install.bat` does, visit [here](https://github.com/rossy/mpv-install).*
5. After it's done, you'll get a prompt to open Control Panel and set MPV as the default player.

That's it for the basic installation of MPV. You can use it without doing anything else. 

### Adding MPV to PATH
1. Open the Start Search, type in `env`, and choose `Edit the system environment variables`.
2. Click the `Environment Variablesâ€¦` button.
3. Under the `System Variables` section (the lower half), find the row with `Path` in the first column, and click `edit`.
4. The `Edit environment variable` UI will appear. Here, you can click `New` and add the path of the directory containing `mpv.exe`.
5. Dismiss all of the dialogs by choosing `OK`. Your changes are saved.

## MacOS
Grab MacOS builds from [here](https://laboratory.stolendata.net/~djinn/mpv_osx/)
### Homebrew 
You will need [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed for this and then run the following command in your terminal.
```
brew install mpv --HEAD
```
## Linux
```
apt install mpv
```
# Additional files/folders

The default path for mpv config is `%APPDATA%/mpv/` but a folder named `portable_config` next to the `mpv.exe` overrides this. Here's a brief overview of files/folders you may want inside either of these folders - 

- `mpv.conf` - MPV user settings.
- `input.conf` - custom keybind settings. You can see the default key bindings [here](https://i.imgur.com/G6Rx74P.png) and syntax [here](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#input-conf).
- `fonts` - Font files in this directory are used by mpv/libass for subtitles.
- `scripts` - This directory is used to load custom scripts, usually `.lua` files. You can find scripts [here](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/User-Scripts).
- `shaders` - This directory is used to load custom shaders like NNEDI3, Ravu, FSRCNNX, etc.
- `script-opts` - A complementary folder to `scripts`, required by some `.lua` scripts to store user settings.

# Custom config
MPV is a great player out-of-the-box but you can customize it further to make it even better.

## Basic Config
The comments are a brief explaination of what each line does.

```yml
#### General
profile=gpu-hq                    #Allows for higher quality playback on MPV. Uses scaling methods that are significantly better than Default MPV, VLC and MPC.
vo=gpu                            #General purpose, customizable, GPU-accelerated video output driver. It supports extended scaling methods, dithering, color management, custom shaders, HDR, and more.
priority=high                     #Makes PC prioritize MPV for allocating resources.
keep-open=yes
save-position-on-quit
script-opts=ytdl_hook-ytdl_path=yt-dlp.exe
cursor-autohide-fs-only
cursor-autohide=100
fullscreen=yes                   #Set to no if you don't want to start in fullscreen

#### Shaders
scale=spline36                    #if lag occurs change spline36 to bicubic_fast
dscale=mitchell                   #if lag occurs change mitchell to bicubic_fast
cscale=spline36                   #if lag occurs change spline36 to bicubic_fast

#### Screenshots
screenshot-format=png
screenshot-high-bit-depth=no
screenshot-png-compression=9       #if it takes too long taking screenshots then delete this line

#### Subtitle Options
demuxer-mkv-subtitle-preroll=yes   #try harder to show embedded soft subtitles when seeking somewhere
sub-ass-vsfilter-blur-compat=no    #Scale \blur tags by video resolution instead of script resolution (enabled by default)
sub-fix-timing=no                  #Adjust subtitle timing is to remove minor gaps or overlaps between subtitles
sub-auto=fuzzy                     #Load all subs containing the media filename.

#### Language Priority
#Sub
slang=jpn,eng,en                   #Add enm before eng for honorifics
alang=jpn,ja,jpn

#Dub                               #uncomment this section to prefer English Dub with subtitles for English Dub.
#alang=eng,en
#slang=zxx,auto,eng
#subs-with-matching-audio=no

```
## Profiles for automatic debanding
Banding is a visual artifact, visual artifacts should never be in a video. 
Example of banding:
![Banding](https://i.imgur.com/32d77H0.jpeg =426x240)
Debanding is the process of removing said banding.

## Profiles for upscaling

These are for a 2160p display, simply adjust the values accordingly for other resolutions. Explanation of scaling - https://thewiki.moe/en/guides/playback#scaling 
```
[2x_upscaling]
    profile-desc='Profile for 1080: 2*1080=2160'
    profile-cond=(height == 1080 and estimated_vf_fps <= 31 and string.match(path, 'http') == nil)
    glsl-shaders='~~/shaders/compute/nnedi3-nns16-win8x4.hook'
    scaler-resizes-only=no  # yes with FSRCNNX_x2_16-0-4-1.glsl

[3x_upscaling]
    profile-desc='Profile for 720: 3*720=2160'
    profile-cond=(height == 720 and string.match(path, 'http') == nil)
    glsl-shaders='~~/shaders/vulkan/compute/ravu-3x-r3.hook'
    scaler-resizes-only=no

[4x_upscaling]
    profile-desc='Profile for 540: 2*2*540=2160'
    profile-cond=(height == 540 and string.match(path, 'http') == nil)
    glsl-shaders-append='~~/shaders/vulkan/compute/ravu-r3.hook'
    glsl-shaders-append='~~/shaders/vulkan/compute/ravu-r3.hook'

## DV/HDR Tonemapping
For watching Dobly Vision or HDR content on an SDR screen you need to tonemap it. To do this change the `vo=gpu` to `vo=gpu-next` and add `tone-mapping=bt.2446a` to your config.
```
vo=gpu-next
tone-mapping=bt.2446a
```
!!!
This will only affect content that needs tonemapping, SDR content will be unaffected. `gpu-next` is still an experimental output driver so you may experience unexpected behavior. You can read more about `gpu-next` [here](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/GPU-Next-vs-GPU).
