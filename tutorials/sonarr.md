# Prerequisite
- Install a torrent client like [qbittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php) and enable Web-UI.
- Install [Prowlarr](https://github.com/Prowlarr/Prowlarr/releases). Do not install it as a service.
- Install [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/). Do not install it as a service.

# Prowlarr
- Launch Prowlarr. It's accessible through http://localhost:9696/ by default.
- Click `Add Indexer`.
- Search `Nyaa` and add it along with any other tracker you want.
- Launch Sonarr. It's accessible through http://localhost:8989/ by default. Go to `Left Pane -> Settings -> General -> API Key -> Copy`
- Now go back to Prowlarr `Left Pane -> Settings -> Apps -> Add Sonarr`

# Sonarr
- Launch Sonarr. It's accessible through http://localhost:8989/ by default.

## Indexers
- Click on `Show Advanced` at the top.
- Go to `Settings -> Indexers` and you'll see that the Indexers you added in Prowlarr have been added to Sonarr.
    - Tag it appropriately because that's how we'll be assigning these specific Indexers to a show. No Tag means it's globally applied.
    - If they don't appear, go back to Prowlarr `Left Pane -> Settings -> Apps -> Sync App Indexers`.
    - Set the RSS interval as per the rules of the Indexer.

## Download Client
- Go to `Settings -> Download Clients` and add your download client.
- The Category (or tag depending on your client of choice) here is important, as this is how Sonarr identifies a download. This is what Sonarr will assign to all the downloads to keep a track of them and will not see them unless they have the specified category/tag.

## Media Management
 - Go to `Settings -> Media Management`
 - Change the naming based on [TRaSH's Recommended Naming Scheme](https://trash-guides.info/Sonarr/Sonarr-recommended-naming-scheme/). You can also alter it based on your preferences.
 - Add Root Folder. This is the folder where your files will be copied/moved/hardlinked to depending on your choice after organizing, e.g, `/HDD/plex/anime`
 - **Note:** *Download Client's save location and Sonarr's Root Folder location must be **different folders** while also being on the **same disk**.*
 
 ## Profiles
Currently, Sonarr's capability of auto-downloading non-seasonal anime is quite bad due to extremely bad naming used by most uploaders and most of the time will grab a sub-par release. This is why we won't be automating those.
- Go to `Left Pane -> Settings -> Profiles -> Release Profiles`
### Seasonals
- We'll be making one release profile for each group or show.
- The first release profile will be for general seasonals and grabbing [`SubsPlease`](https://nyaa.si/user/subsplease). Tag it appropriately because that's how we'll be assigning these profiles to a show. No Tag means it's globally applied.
[![Release Profile](https://i.imgur.com/QoLA0t8.png "SubsPlease Profile")](https://i.imgur.com/QoLA0t8.png "SubsPlease Profile")
- You can make as many profiles you want for fansub releases as you want.
- Once you are done adding all the groups you want to grab, it should look like this:
[![Release Profiles](https://i.imgur.com/7m6Ybgp.png "Release Profiles")](https://i.imgur.com/7m6Ybgp.png "Release Profiles")
- **Note:**
    - If you want to grab a release from more than one group for a show (either based on scores, preferences or just whoever releases faster), you'll have to make a new `Release Profile` with multiple release groups in the `MUST CONTAIN` field to get the desired result ([example](https://i.imgur.com/SBpEoJQ.png)).
    - This is because for a release to be grabbed, all the `Release Profile` tags you assign to a show must be satisfied. Assigning two profiles tags like `ly` (LostYears) and `sp` (SubsPlease) to a single show will not work because that tells Sonarr to find a release with **BOTH** words present in the folder/filename ([example](https://i.imgur.com/mXQEJrn.png)).

## Adding a Seasonal Show
- Click on the Search bar on the top right and find the show you want to add.
- Select its location and assign the indexer tag and the release tag.
- Check the `Start search for missing episodes` option and click the `Add` button. 
- From personal experience, it's better to use `Any` profile instead of `1080p` due to how multiple anime releasers don't bother putting `1080p` in the title, causing them to be rejected. You might also have to allow `Unknown` under `Any` profile because some releasers don't put any information in the title.
[![Seasonal](https://i.imgur.com/0FQGR1E.gif "Seasonal")](https://i.imgur.com/0FQGR1E.gif "Seasonal")
- It'll now show up in your client along with the `tv-sonarr` tag and Sonarr will import a hardlinked copy into the Root Folder (`/HDD/plex/anime`).
[![Qbit](https://i.imgur.com/271wNmN.png "Qbit")](https://i.imgur.com/271wNmN.png "Qbit")
- Your new folder structure should look like this:

## Downloading Complete Seasons/Shows
- Click on the Search bar on the top right and find the show you want to add.
    - **Note:** *Do NOT check the `Start search for missing episodes` option.*
- We will manually pick a release and then import it through Sonarr for organizing.
- (Optional) Head over to [SeaDex](https://releases.moe) to grab the best release.
- You can do this by simply navigating to your handpicked release's folder via `Left Pane -> Wanted -> Manual Import -> Navigate to the folder containing the episodes`

## Hardlinks
- [What is a Hardlink?](https://trash-guides.info/Hardlinks/Hardlinks-and-Instant-Moves/#what-are-hardlinks)
- Hardlinks are enabled by default. So everything above should have been hardlinked instead of copied/moved.
### Check Hardlinks
- For Windows, the best way to check Hardlinks is [FindLinks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/findlinks)
[![Hardlinks](https://i.imgur.com/pRZwkGG.png "Hardlinks")](https://i.imgur.com/pRZwkGG.png "Hardlinks")
- For Linux, [TRaSH](https://trash-guides.info/) already covers [three methods to check Hardlinks](https://trash-guides.info/Hardlinks/Check-if-hardlinks-are-working/) so I won't be covering those.

### Troubleshooting
If your hardlinks aren't working, there could be a few oversights causing this:
- You cannot cross file systems between hardlinks so make sure you aren't doing that. TRaSH covers this well [here](https://trash-guides.info/Hardlinks/How-to-setup-for/).
- Permission issues with file systems, especially if you are using NTFS formatted drives on a Unix system. Keep in mind that you can't change the permissions on an NTFS  file system the same way you would on an EXT4 file system
- Executing the commands listed down below will recursively change the permissions of the targeted folder/drive to `775/664` (`$USER`). Having the folder/drive permissions set to `775/664` will prevent Sonarr from running into permission issues when hardlinking/copying files.
```
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /data
sudo chmod -R a=,a+rX,u+w,g+w /data

```
