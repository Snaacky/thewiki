!!!
You'll see a few confusing terms here, like `lt20`, `qt5`, and `qt6`. You don't really have to know anything about them besides the fact that they are builds with underlying breaking changes which are not yet widely adopted which is why you should avoid them.

3. Run the installer and you're pretty much done. You can look around the settings if you want but the default values are already good.
