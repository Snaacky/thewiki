## Basic Config

mpv is a great player out-of-the-box which can be extensively customized to your liking.

We recommend taking your time to create your own config. If you want to get up and running quickly, we suggest using the generic `mpv.conf` config below:

==- :icon-file-code: Generic `mpv.conf`

```properties
## Video
profile=high-quality
vo=gpu-next
gpu-api=vulkan
scale-antiring=0.5
deband=no

# Dither
# This must be set to match your monitor's bit depth
dither-depth = 8

## Behavior (personal preference)
keep-open=yes
save-position-on-quit

## Screenshots
screenshot-format=png
screenshot-dir="~/Pictures/mpv"
screenshot-template="%F-%p-%n"

## Language Priority
# Sub
# Add enm before eng for honorifics
slang=eng,en
alang=jpn,ja

# Dub
# Uncomment this section to prefer English dub with subtitles for English dub

## Advanced Config

mpv can be fine-tuned to meet your specific needs, from tweaking playback behavior to customizing video, audio, and subtitle settings. This section outlines the common options that can improve your experience.

!!!
This guide assumes you know the location of your config folder. *See [Config Overview](#config-overview) to see where to locate your config files.*
!!!

### Debanding

Color banding is a visual artifact that is typically seen in gradients, where the colors can be easily differentiated by the human eye. *See [Tom Scott's video explaining color banding](https://youtu.be/h9j89L8eQQk).*

<p align="center">
   <a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78981416/214381256-e5722886-57d7-4cd4-834e-edbd30b432e0.png">
   <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78981416/214381256-e5722886-57d7-4cd4-834e-edbd30b432e0.png" alt="Banding (left) vs. No banding (right)" width="640" height="360">
   </a>
<p align="center">Banding (left) vs. No banding (right)</p>
</p>

To enable debanding in mpv, apply the following changes to your config:

+++ `mpv.conf`

```properties
## Deband
# Set deband to "no" as we only need to enable it for specific cases
deband=no
deband-iterations=4
deband-grain=48
```

!!!warning
Your deband settings should be placed after your [`profile`](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#profiles) in order to prevent conflict.
!!!

+++ `input.conf`

```properties
D cycle deband
```

+++

After applying your changes, debanding can be applied at any time by pressing `Shift` + `D`.

### Scaling

Scaling is the process of taking content that does not match your screen resolution and resizing it to fit your display. *See the [Playback Guide](/guides/playback/#scaling) for more information.*

[mpv](https://mpv.io) has a built-in profile called `high-quality` which enables better upscaling using `ewa_lanczossharp`. By default, mpv uses `lanczos` and `hermite`. *This option is necessary to enable even if you use an external shader, as it can act as a fallback.*

!!!warning
`high-quality` enables debanding by default, which is not recommended for high-quality sources. It should be followed by `deband=no`.
!!!

Scalers only work when the resolution of your video does not match your display. They do not activate if the content resolution already matches your display resolution.

+++ High-End PCs
If you use high-end hardware, we suggest using [nnedi3-nns256-win8x4](https://github.com/bjin/mpv-prescalers/blob/master/nnedi3-nns256-win8x4.hook).

Download the shader file and place it in your `shaders` folder.

To use the shader, add the following to your `mpv.conf`:

```properties
glsl-shaders="~~/shaders/nnedi3-nns256-win8x4.hook"
```

To activate it with a key, add the following to your `input.conf`, replacing `G` with the bind of your choice, if necessary (case-sensitive):

```properties
G change-list glsl-shaders toggle "~~/shaders/nnedi3-nns256-win8x4.hook"
```

+++ Mid-Range PCs
If you use mid-range hardware, we suggest sticking to mpv's built-in `high-quality` profile.

To use the profile, add the following to the top of your `mpv.conf`:

```properties
## Video
profile=high-quality
vo=gpu-next
gpu-api=vulkan
scale-antiring=0.5
deband=no

# Dither
# This must be set to match your monitor's bit depth
dither-depth = 8
```

!!!warning
`dither-depth` should be set to match your monitor's bit depth to prevent [banding](#debanding).
!!!

This is included in the [Basic Config](#basic-config).

+++ Low-End PCs
If you use low-end hardware, we suggest sticking to mpv's built-in `fast` profile, which prioritizes performance over quality.

To use the profile, add the following to the top of your `mpv.conf`:

```properties
profile=fast
```

+++

### Subtitle Restyling

Most releases will use their own font for `.ass` subtitles. These can be manually overridden by mpv, which can help improve readability or match personal preferences.

Below are a couple of commonly used styles:

+++ Gandhi Sans

![Gandhi Sans](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78981416/248583226-18cece1d-4cd6-4a55-8fbf-8fa587399262.png)

[Download this font here](https://fontmeme.com/fonts/gandhi-sans-font) or use the button below:

[!button icon="download" variant="primary" text="Gandhi Sans"](/static/playback/fonts/gandhi-sans.zip)

Run the `.otf` font file to install it system-wide or put it in your `fonts` folder. Add the following to your `mpv.conf`:

```properties
## Restyle Subtitles
# Set sub-ass-override to "no" as we only need to enable it for specific cases
sub-ass-override=no
sub-ass-style-overrides=playresx=1920,playresy=1080
sub-font="Gandhi Sans"
sub-font-size=50
sub-color="#FFFFFF"
sub-border-size=2.4
sub-border-color="#FF000000"
sub-shadow-color="#A0000000"
sub-shadow-offset=0.75
sub-bold=yes
sub-ass-style-overrides=Kerning=yes
```

+++ Cabin

![Cabin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78981416/248583220-ac376f74-ce9f-4c3c-800b-370355a841f0.png)

[Download this font here](https://fontmeme.com/fonts/cabin-font) or use the button below:

[!button icon="download" variant="primary" text="Cabin"](/static/playback/fonts/cabin.zip)

Run the `.ttf` font file to install it system-wide or put it in your `fonts` folder. Add the following to your `mpv.conf`:

```properties
## Restyle Subtitles

# Set sub-ass-override to "no" as we only need to enable it for specific cases
sub-ass-override=no
sub-ass-style-overrides=playresx=1920,playresy=1080
sub-font="Cabin"
sub-font-size=50
sub-color="#FFFFFFFF"
sub-border-size=2.4
sub-border-color="#FF000000"
sub-shadow-color="#A0000000"
sub-shadow-offset=0.8
sub-ass-style-overrides=Kerning=yes
```

+++

To activate it with a key, add the following to your `input.conf`, replacing `k` with the bind of your choice, if necessary (case-sensitive):

```properties
k cycle_values sub-ass-override "force" "no"
```

### Auto Profiles

Auto profiles allow users to automate actions based on certain conditions. Tasks such as [debanding](#debanding) and [subtitle restyling](#subtitle-restyling) can be applied automatically when these conditions are met, such as file names.

For instance, some seasonal releases may exhibit banding issues and use subjectively less-appealing subtitle fonts. To address this, we can create a `simulcast` auto profile, which automatically applies [debanding](#debanding) and [subtitle restyling](#subtitle-restyling) when playing releases uploaded by SubsPlease, Erai-raws, Tsundere-Raws, VARYG, or HorribleSubs.

Add the following to the end of your `mpv.conf`:

```properties
## Auto profiles

[simulcast]
profile-cond=string.match(p.filename, "SubsPlease") or string.match(p.filename, "Erai%-raws") or string.match(p.filename, "Tsundere%-Raws") or string.match(p.filename, "%-VARYG") or string.match(p.filename, "HorribleSubs")
profile-restore=copy
sub-fix-timing=yes
sub-ass-override=force
deband=yes
```

!!!warning
Your auto profile(s) should be placed at the end of your `mpv.conf` in order to prevent conflict.
!!!

### Custom Scripts

mpv supports loading custom scripts, allowing you to further expand the player's functionality.

Below is a list of some popular scripts:

- [autocrop](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/TOOLS/lua/autocrop.lua) - Automatically crop the video by using lavfi's cropdetect filter to detect black bars
