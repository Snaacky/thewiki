# mpv

[mpv](https://mpv.io) is a versatile and lightweight media player with extensive customizability. It is used and recommended by most enthusiasts as it supports a wide range of video, audio, and subtitle formats. Additionally, it offers many advanced features and is available on multiple platforms.

## Installation

### Windows

==- üîß Installing mpv

1. Download the latest Windows build of [mpv](https://mpv.io) from [mpv-winbuild](https://github.com/zhongfly/mpv-winbuild/releases/latest). *For most users, this should be `mpv-x86_64-YYYYMMDD-git-abcxyz.7z`*
2. Once downloaded, extract the archive's contents to your specified location
!!!warning
This folder cannot be changed after installation. If you wish to change it in the future, you will need to uninstall it first.
!!!
3. Navigate to the `installer` folder and run `mpv-install.bat`. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete installation

==- üç® Installing mpv via Scoop

[Scoop](https://scoop.sh) is a command line package manager for Windows. Unlike other installation methods, Scoop downloads and manages packages in a portable way, keeping them neatly isolated in `%userprofile%/scoop` and automatically adding them to your PATH.

Scoop can be installed using their install script in a PowerShell window:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
irm get.scoop.sh | iex
```

Then, install mpv using `scoop`:

```powershell
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install extras/mpv-git
```

+++ Updating mpv

```powershell
scoop update mpv-git
```

+++ Uninstalling mpv

```powershell
scoop uninstall mpv-git
```

+++

==- üç¥ Installing a fork

!!!info
We suggest sticking with the official mpv player as forks tend to lag behind in updates.
!!!

[mpv](https://mpv.io) can also be found in the various forks below:

- [mpc-qt](https://github.com/mpc-qt/mpc-qt)
- [mpv.net](https://github.com/mpvnet-player/mpv.net) [!badge icon="apps" variant="info" text="Microsoft Store"](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/9N64SQZTB3LM)

==- üì¶ Installing a pre-configured build

If you don't want to setup mpv yourself, a portable build of mpv is available below. This is pre-configured to have the settings described in the [Basic Config](#basic-config) and [Advanced Config](#advanced-config) and is automatically updated daily. The `portable_config` folder can also be downloaded separately if you wish to add it to your existing mpv installation.

[!file text="mpv" icon="play"](https://github.com/Snaacky/thewiki/releases/tag/mpv)
[!file text="portable_config" icon="package"](https://github.com/Snaacky/thewiki/releases/download/mpv/portable_config.7z)

===

==- üìÅ Adding mpv to PATH

If you want to access mpv from the command line, you will need to add it to Windows PATH:

1. In *Windows Settings* -> *System* -> *About*, locate *Advanced System Settings*. Head to *Advanced* and click on *Environment Variables...*
2. Under *System Variables*, select *Path* and click on *Edit...*
3. Click *New* and point the variable to the folder where `mpv.exe` is located/installed
4. Launch a new terminal window. *mpv can be accessed from the command line using `mpv`*

## Basic Config

mpv is a great player out-of-the-box which can be extensively customized to your liking.

We recommend taking your time to create your own config. If you want to get up and running quickly, we suggest using the generic `mpv.conf` config below:

==- :icon-file-code: Generic `mpv.conf`

:::code source="/static/tutorials/mpv/portable_config/mpv.conf" range="1-30" language="properties":::

## Advanced Config

mpv can be fine-tuned to meet your specific needs, from tweaking playback behavior to customizing video, audio, and subtitle settings. This section outlines the common options that can improve your experience.

!!!
This guide assumes you know the location of your config folder. *See [Config Overview](#config-overview) to see where to locate your config files.*
!!!

### Debanding

Color banding is a visual artifact that is typically seen in gradients, where the colors can be easily differentiated by the human eye. *See [Tom Scott's video explaining color banding](https://youtu.be/h9j89L8eQQk).*

<p align="center">
   <a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78981416/214381256-e5722886-57d7-4cd4-834e-edbd30b432e0.png">
   <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78981416/214381256-e5722886-57d7-4cd4-834e-edbd30b432e0.png" alt="Banding (left) vs. No banding (right)" width="640" height="360">
   </a>
<p align="center">Banding (left) vs. No banding (right)</p>
</p>

Newer versions of mpv now ship with debanding capabilities, so no additional configuration is required. You can enable debanding anytime during playback by pressing `b` (default keybind).

For sources where the default debanding isn't effective enough, you can apply more aggressive debanding profiles such as:

```properties
[BrazzersDeband]
deband=yes
deband-iterations=4
deband-threshold=64
deband-range=20
deband-grain=32
```

```properties
[HiroshimaDeband]
deband-iterations=4
deband-threshold=100
deband-range=8
deband-grain=32
```

!!!warning
Keep in mind that stronger settings will cause a loss of detail and should be reserved for situations where the loss of detail is acceptable for reducing banding.
!!!

### Scaling

Scaling is the process of taking content that does not match your screen resolution and resizing it to fit your display. *See the [Playback Guide](/guides/playback/#scaling) for more information.*

[mpv](https://mpv.io) has a built-in profile called `high-quality` which enables better upscaling using `ewa_lanczossharp`. By default, mpv uses `lanczos` and `hermite`. *This option is necessary to enable even if you use an external shader, as it can act as a fallback.*

Scalers only work when the resolution of your video does not match your display. They do not activate if the content resolution already matches your display resolution.

+++ High-End PCs

If you use high-end hardware, we recommend using the following shaders:

- [ArtCNN_C4F32.glsl](https://github.com/Artoriuz/ArtCNN/blob/main/GLSL/ArtCNN_C4F32.glsl) for higher quality sources
- [nnedi3-nns128-win8x4.hook](https://github.com/bjin/mpv-prescalers/blob/master/compute/nnedi3-nns128-win8x4.hook) for lower quality sources

Download both the shader files and place them in your `shaders` folder.

Next, add the following to your `input.conf`, replacing `g` with the bind of your choice, if necessary (case-sensitive):

:::code source="/static/tutorials/mpv/portable_config/input.conf" range="2" language="properties":::

To toggle the shader, press `g` during playback to select the suitable shader.

+++ Mid-Range PCs

If you use mid-range hardware, we recommend sticking to mpv's built-in `high-quality` profile.

To use the profile, add the following to the top of your `mpv.conf`:

:::code source="/static/tutorials/mpv/portable_config/mpv.conf" range="1-4" language="properties":::

This is included in the [Basic Config](#basic-config).

+++ Low-End PCs

If you use low-end hardware, we recommend sticking to mpv's default profile, which aims for a balance between quality and performance. No other changes need to be made as it is used by default.

+++ Potato PCs

If you use very low-end hardware, we recommend sticking to mpv's `fast` profile, which prioritizes performance over quality.

To use the profile, add the following to the top of your `mpv.conf`:

```properties
profile=fast
```

+++

### Dither

Dither is an intentionally applied noise filter that aims to help eliminate various visual artifacts, such as color banding during playback.

By default, mpv uses dithering to match the content bit depth to your display's bit depth. *However, in some instances, it may fail to detect the correct bit depth of your display automatically, causing the wrong bit depth to be used and adding banding during playback.*

To avoid introducing banding during playback, we recommend explicitly defining your display's bit depth. Most modern displays use the 8-bit color depth, however you can manually check this:

- For Windows, this can be found in **Settings** -> **Display** -> **Advanced display settings** -> **Display information** -> **Bit depth**

Then, set your display's bit depth in your `mpv.conf`:

:::code source="/static/tutorials/mpv/portable_config/mpv.conf" range="8" language="properties":::

### Subtitle Restyling

Most releases will use their own font for `.ass` subtitles. These can be manually overridden by mpv, which can help improve readability or match personal preferences.

!!!warning
Restyling subtitles may lead to incorrect rendering in some cases.
!!!

Below are a couple of commonly used styles:

==- :icon-project-roadmap: Gandhi Sans

```

===

To activate it with a key, add the following to your `input.conf`, replacing `k` with the bind of your choice, if necessary (case-sensitive):

:::code source="/static/tutorials/mpv/portable_config/input.conf" range="5" language="properties":::

### Auto Profiles

Auto profiles allow users to automate actions based on certain conditions. Tasks such as [debanding](#debanding) and [subtitle restyling](#subtitle-restyling) can be applied automatically when these conditions are met, such as file names.

For instance, some seasonal releases may exhibit banding issues and use subjectively less-appealing subtitle fonts. To address this, we can create a `simulcast` auto profile, which automatically applies [debanding](#debanding) and [subtitle restyling](#subtitle-restyling) when playing releases uploaded by SubsPlease, Erai-raws, Tsundere-Raws, VARYG, or HorribleSubs.

Add the following to the end of your `mpv.conf`:

:::code source="/static/tutorials/mpv/portable_config/mpv.conf" range="32-40" language="properties":::

!!!warning
Your auto profile(s) should be placed at the end of your `mpv.conf` in order to prevent conflict.
!!!

### Custom Scripts

mpv supports loading custom scripts, allowing you to further expand the player's functionality.

Below is a list of some popular scripts:

- [autocrop](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/TOOLS/lua/autocrop.lua) - Automatically crop the video by using lavfi's cropdetect filter to detect black bars
- [autoload](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/TOOLS/lua/autoload.lua) - Automatically adds all files present in the folder to a playlist
