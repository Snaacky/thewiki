## Streaming

Unofficial - [TheIndex](https://theindex.moe/)

Official - [/r/anime list of legal streams](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/legal_streams)

Streaming sites require no user setup and are convenient; however, streams typically compress video, which reduces quality, and the site may have unfavorable features like ads. Aiming for compatibility, streaming sites are unable to use efficient codecs like x265. Users may find a similar, if not better, experience to streaming by torrenting x265 mini encodes from nyaa. These small encodes are useful for individuals with data limits. Here is a comparison between mini encodes and most popular streaming sites - https://slow.pics/c/pjYaqdnr.

Official streams have better quality but are also larger (~1.3GB per episode for 1080p). They can be obtained by torrenting from groups like SubsPlease, who rip untouched official streams.

## Torrenting

Torrent files can be found and downloaded from trackers like [nyaa.si](https://nyaa.si). Use [GoodbyeDPI](https://github.com/ValdikSS/GoodbyeDPI), or follow this [tutorial](/tutorials/unblock) to unblock sites.

The downloaded .torrent file or the magnet link has to be opened in your torrent client - [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php) for PC and [LibreTorrent](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.proninyaroslav.libretorrent)/[Flud](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.delphicoder.flud) for Android. After the download is complete, the torrents do not need to be removed from the client.

The speed is dependent on the number of seeds and their connection quality. You can connect to more seeds and improve speeds with [port forwarding](/en/guides/torrenting#how-to-port-forward). You may want to use a [VPN](/en/faq/vpn) or a [seedbox](/en/guides/torrenting#what-is-a-seedbox) for downloading torrents to avoid receiving a copyright infringement notice from your ISP.

Advantages of torrents include access to more options with better quality/size ratios and automation through RSS or Sonarr.
