# Music
## Content Resources

[Soulseek](http://www.slsknet.org/news/)
- P2P network where people share music files of their own. Great way to find lossless music and a lot of relevant music. 

## Spectral Analysis 

- Since Soulseek doesn't have strict rules regarding upconversion (lossy->lossless), many files may be of dubious quality. This can be verified through spectral analysis. A full guide for doing so along with the required software can be found [here](https://interviewfor.red/en/spectrals.html) and [here](https://erikstechcorner.com/2020/09/how-to-check-if-your-flac-files-are-really-lossless/).

## Comprehensive Guides

- [The Mega Music Ripping Guide](https://ori5000.github.io/musicripping.html) guide containing instructions on how to rip music from a variety of different popular sources. 

- [Sharky's Music Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Poj4p2W0C0Napmwd7bcustlgWrkgp71dy9HlZwUr46w/edit) is a massive document containing all sorts of tutorials and explanations for commonly-seen aspects of music ripping and uploading.
