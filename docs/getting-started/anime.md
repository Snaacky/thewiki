# Anime

## Streaming

!!!
See [The Index](https://theindex.moe) for a more comprehensive list of unofficial anime streaming sites.

*Looking for official streaming sites?* See [r/anime's list of legal streams](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/legal_streams).
!!!

Streaming sites are generally preferred by most anime watchers as they require no additional setup and are easy to use while being convenient.

However, some sites will heavily compress video/audio and may have ads. *We suggest using a reliable content blocker, such as [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com). Additionally, you may want to consider torrenting if you care about quality.*

Aiming for compatibility, they are also unable to use efficient codecs like x265. *If data limits are a concern, torrenting x265 mini encodes may be a better option. See the [quality comparison between mini encodes and popular streaming sites](https://slow.pics/c/pjYaqdnr).*

Official streams have better quality but are also typically larger (~1.3GB per episode for 1080p). *They can be obtained by torrenting from groups like SubsPlease, who rip untouched streams.*

*See the [Streaming Sites](/sourcing/streaming/) sourcing guide and [Quality Guide](/guides/quality) for more information.*

## Torrenting

Torrenting, while can sometimes require more setup, allows for more flexibility and accessibility for watching your shows.

Unlike streaming sites, releases will have better quality and access to BD releases. *Some shows will also have fansub choices, which may be preferred over official subtitles.*

Torrenting requires the use of a torrent client, such as [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download). Shows are shared in the form of .torrent files or magnet links, which can be found on trackers such as [Nyaa](https://nyaa.si). These are used by your torrent client to know what to download. *Download speeds are dependent on the number of seeds available and connection quality.*

!!!warning
Downloading anime torrents may be illegal depending on where you live. *To avoid receiving a copyright infringement notice from your ISP, you may want to consider using a [VPN](/getting-started/torrenting#vpn) or a [seedbox](/guides/torrenting#what-is-a-seedbox).*
!!!

Additionally, you may choose to automatically fetch and download shows using RSS or Sonarr. *Check out the [RSS Tutorial](/tutorials/rss) on how to set up RSS with your torrent client.*

*See the [Torrenting Guide](/guides/torrenting) for more information.*

## Playback

A brief list of recommended media player applications.

!!!warning
VLC is not recommended as it introduces visual artifacts, displays wrong colors, and breaks intensive subtitles. *We suggest using alternative media players.*
