## Streaming

!!!
*See [The Index](https://theindex.moe) for a comprehensive list of unofficial anime streaming sites.*

Looking for official streaming sites? *See [r/anime's list of legal streams](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/legal_streams).*
!!!

Streaming is the process of downloading and playing back content live from the server.

Unlike [torrenting](#torrenting), streaming sites can be easily accessed through your web browser. This makes it convenient to access across all of your devices and makes it easy to start watching without having to worry about additional setup or configuration. Some streaming services will also have dedicated applications for a more fluent user experience, such as [Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com).

However, most streaming sites will compress the video and audio to save bandwidth. With unofficial streaming sites in particular, video and audio are often heavily compressed, combined with intrusive ads/pop-ups across the site. *If you plan to use these sites, we suggest using a reliable content blocker, such as [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com).*

If you like convenience, streaming sites can be a perfectly fine option for your watching needs. They offer access to a large library of shows with ease and do not require much technical knowledge to get started. *If you want to consider streaming, we suggest starting by looking at [various quality comparisons](/guides/quality/#quality-comparisons) to see whether it is fine for you.*

*See the [streaming sites](/sourcing/streaming/) sourcing guide and [quality guide](/guides/quality) for more information.*

## Torrenting

Torrenting is the process of sharing and downloading files over the internet.

Unlike [streaming](#streaming), torrents provide access to better releases, such as [Blu-rays whenever they're available](/guides/quality/#blu-ray-vs-web) and greater video quality. These releases can sometimes be better than official streaming services, as they allow for more quality options and easy access to shows that may otherwise be unavailable in your region. Some shows will also have [fansubbed releases](/guides/quality/#fansubs), which may be preferred over official subtitles.

However, torrenting requires some time to setup as opposed to streaming, making it more inconvenient for most users. To start, torrenting requires the use of a torrent client and access to a torrent tracker. Additionally, downloading anime torrents may be illegal in your region. *To avoid receiving a copyright infringement notice from your ISP, you may want to consider using a [VPN](/getting-started/torrenting/#vpn) or [seedbox](/getting-started/torrenting/#seedbox) while torrenting.*

If you like to prioritize quality, torrenting can be an amazing option for your watching needs. They offer more flexibility with how you want to watch your shows and can be better than official streaming services.

*See the [torrenting guide](/getting-started/torrenting) for more information.*
