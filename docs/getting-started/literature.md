# Literature

## Manga

### Sourcing Files (for standalone readers)

[Nyaa](https://nyaa.si) - The best public source for downloading manga

Official Digital Rips
Search for the English title and add `Digital` for the best rips. For example - `Attack on Titan Digital`.
In the rare cases where multiple groups release the same manga, prioritise the newer release as it's likely to have been ripped from a superior source.
If the files are dead on public trackers, you may have luck with DDL links in their descriptions, or alternatively setting up [DC++](https://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/p1z313/comic_trackers_other_than_32pages/h8iu5uh/)

Scanlation Rips
Search both the English and Japanese title by adding `|` in between. For example - `Attack on Titan|Shingeki no Kyojin` and sort by file size.
Although these are significantly lower quality, not all manga get official digital releases, and downloading as opposed to reading online allows you to utilise the better scaling that standalone readers can provide.

## Light Novels

Official vs Fan Translations - In general, official translations are more consistent, localized and flow better as a result of having professional translators and editors working on the project. At the same time, some readers may not prefer the excessive localization, editing or censorship in certain novels, which is where fan translations become the better choice. Seven Seas was guilty of doing this with Mushoku Tensei and Classroom of the Elite under the guise of localization - [1](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-02-17/seven-seas-addresses-mushoku-tensei-classroom-of-the-elite-light-novel-localization-changes/.169582), [2](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2021-04-26/why-seven-seas-altered-its-light-novels/.171956), [3](https://boundingintocomics.com/2021/02/21/seven-seas-admits-to-heavy-handed-censorship-of-classroom-of-the-elite-and-mushoku-tensei-jobless-reincarnation/). The problems were apparently fixed later in revised releases.

Fan translations can range from better than official to unreadable machine translated garbage. It's best to consult the community of each series to determine what their preferred version is, and go with that. In most cases, going with official is a safe bet.

### Sourcing

[Nyaa](https://nyaa.si/) is the first place you should check for official releases.

Fan TLs can be found from novelupdates or from the reddit/discord communities of the series. Not all communites will allow sharing these, make sure to check their wiki and pins for information.

[Novelupdates](https://www.novelupdates.com/) - provides information about translation groups, their status and progress, links to their sites, as well as lots of other things about the series - genres, categories, tags, ratings, reviews etc.
