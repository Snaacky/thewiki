### Sourcing

+++ Downloads

[Nyaa](https://nyaa.si) [!badge icon=":heart:" variant="primary" text="Recommended"]
:   Public torrent tracker with the most high-quality official digital rips

    Scanlations can also be found here, though significantly less than aggregator sites.

    ==- :icon-search: Searching tips
    - **Official Digital Rips:** Search for the English title and add `Digital` to your search (e.g. `Attack on Titan Digital`). When searching, prioritize newer releases, as they're likely from better sources compared to older releases.
    - **Scanlation Rips:** Search for both the English and Japanese/native title by [adding the `|` operator](/sourcing/public-trackers/#search-operators) in between (e.g. `Attack on Titan|Shingeki no Kyojin`) and sort by file size. Although these can be significantly lower in quality, note that not all manga get official digital releases and scanlations may be your only option.

[MangaLife](https://manga4life.com)/[MangaSee](https://mangasee123.com)

!!!
Aggregators use downscaled and compressed images, resulting in lower image quality than digital rips.

### Reading

+++ PC

[mpv](https://mpv.io/installation/) [!badge icon=":heart:" variant="primary" text="Best Quality"]
:   Standalone reader with the highest quality scaling on PC

    This should be used with the [mpv-manga-reader script](https://github.com/Dudemanguy/mpv-manga-reader) in order to enable basic manga reader functionality. *See [how to install custom scripts in mpv](/tutorials/mpv/#custom-scripts).*

    ==- :icon-file-media: Recommended scaling settings
    We recommend using the following scaling config for reading manga. This config will not affect standard video playback. To use it, add the following to your `mpv.conf`:
    ```properties
    [Manga]
    profile-desc="Read Manga"
    profile-cond=filename and filename:match('%.cbz$') or filename:match('%.cbr$') or filename:match('%.zip$') or filename:match('%.rar$') ~= nil
    profile=high-quality
    dscale=mitchell
    deband=no
    ```
    ==-
    ==- :icon-sliders: Fixing black levels
    mpv allows you to manually fix black levels with the brightness and contrast controls. To use them, add the following to your `input.conf` and customise the values to your liking (default keybinds are `B` and `N`):
    ```properties
    B no-osd add contrast -4; no-osd add brightness 4; show-text "Black Level: ${brightness}"
    N no-osd add contrast 4; no-osd add brightness -4; show-text "Black Level: ${brightness}"
    ```
    This should only be used on sources where [obvious blacks appear gray](/static/literature/incorrect-black-levels.png). The black level value should be decreased [until the grays become black](/static/literature/correct-black-levels.png). *Generally, `-16` works for most sources.*
    ==-
    ==- :icon-sparkle-fill: Touchscreen support
    mpv recently implemented support for multitouch gestures through lua scripting. This allows for much more complex touch functionalily without the necessity for third party software. 
    
    The [touch-manga-mpv](https://github.com/guyman624/touch-manga-mpv) script allows for page turning and black level adjustment with touch gestures.
    
    There are also third party programs, such as [GestureSign](https://gesturesign.win), which allow you to convert gestures to keypresses ([example setup](/static/literature/gesturesign-example.png)).  
    You should also add the following into your `mpv.conf` to avoid triggering the OSD when swiping:
    ```properties
    no-osc
    no-window-dragging
    ```
