# Hentai

## Illustrations

#### Subscription-Based Content

[Kemono](https://kemono.party/)
- Best place to find content drops locked behind paywalls (e.g. Fantia, Fanbox, DLSite, Patreon). 

- Note: If the artist's romanized username doesn't return any results, check their page for its hiragana/kanji equivalent.

#### Wallpapers

[Konachan](https://konachan.com/) 
- Dedicated resource for high-quality anime & hentai wallpapers. Similar layout to other *booru imageboards.

#### General-Purpose Content

[Yande.re](https://yande.re/)/[Gelbooru](https://gelbooru.com/) 
- Well-established sites with vast amounts of user-uploaded content easily searchable due to their usage of various filter tags. Note: Gelbooru has many tags blacklisted by default; to access them, click [here](https://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=account&s=options), check the box that says "Display all site content" and click "Save" at the bottom of the page.

- If you can't find what you're looking for on either of these sites, consider checking [Sankaku Channel](https://chan.sankakucomplex.com/) for it. Note: some content requires you to make an account to access, but account registrations are open.

[Sukebei](https://sukebei.nyaa.si/)

- The NSFW-only version of nyaa.si with well-seeded uploads, Sukebei offers both real-life and hentai torrents.

## Doujinshi

[E-Hentai](https://e-hentai.org/)
- Extensive database of doujinshi uploaded and maintained by an active community. Additional features include an entire forum and a bounty system where users can upload specific content in exchange for rewards.

- If a certain query doesn't return an expected upload, head to "Show Advanced Options" and click on "Browse Expunged Galleries"; uploads removed by users will be shown. However, keep in mind that the site is frequently subject to bothersome copyright takedowns.

[Ex-Hentai](https://exhentai.org/) 
- Requires an E-Hentai account to be logged in to access. If the site remains blank after this, clear your browser's cookies or open a private tab and log in through there. 

- Top place to look for content that may have been taken down from E-Hentai.

[Anchira (formerly Koshoku)](https://anchira.to/)
- If neither E-Hentai nor Ex-Hentai have what you're looking for, there's a fair chance it may be on here. This site boasts an ever-growing collection of English-published doujinshi that oftentimes is from a blacklisted publisher on the aforementioned sites.

[Nhentai](https://nhentai.net/) - Scrapes and packages E-Hentai's content into a simple, cleaner design. Preferred by many for its minimalistic feel and easy navigation.

[hitomi](https://hitomi.la/) - Solid nhentai alternative with sizeable amounts of content. Contains a simple yet useful feature within its homepage that allows recently uploaded doujinshi to be filtered by 40+ languages.

[ImHentai](https://imhentai.xxx/) - Very frequently-updated uploads consisting of doujinshi and user-made collections, similar to E-Hentai. 

## Games

[Nutaku](https://www.nutaku.net/) - If you've gone on 18+ sites before without and adblocker, there's a good chance that you've seen an ad for this site. Regardless, they offer a plethora of well-made games that are free-to-play.

[Sukebei](https://sukebei.nyaa.si/) - In addition to being a prime public tracker to snatch doujinshi off of, Sukebei also offers an extensive library of nukige/eroge.
