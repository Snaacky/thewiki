# Creating your own Site

This FAQ is targetting experienced devs or site owners who have at least a basic knowledge and give them a few points to consider before making their service available to the public. We will not recommend any service or solution. If you'd be blindly reliant on our tips, it would be quite foolish, research on your own and form your own opinion!

## How can I create my own site?
If you need to ask this question, we strongly discourage you from starting one of your first programming projects with something that might put you in jail, depending on your country.

## Where do I host the content?
If you are questioning yourself from where you should serve the content to the public, here are some things you should consider:
- Self-hosting can involve a lot of work, but you are independent of any cloud provider that may shut you down at any moment.
- If you want to rely on a [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network), always consider alternatives and have a local copy of all the data.

## What should I do to protect my real identity?
- First of all, do **NOT** host your server from your home network.
- Ideally, use a proxy/load balancer to mask your servers.
- Register your domains via a registrar that does not require your real identity or just doesn't care about it.
- Create a secure, separate mail account solely to manage your server.
- Be careful about how you accept donations, if you do, consider the fact that using your PayPal or bank account will directly reveal your identity.
- Don't be stupid.

## How can I finance my service?

* You should first consider the design choices you made or will make regarding how high the server load will increase with an increasing user-base. Putting some effort in here early can save you a lot of effort and money later.

* Donations are also a possible option, but users tend not to donate as frequently or as much if you don't offer any benefits. Be wise about how you balance your system before you aggregate your users.

* Making it a paid site: You will have to offer some serious solid features and have some reputation so users will buy a subscription. This is the hardest way of getting users and keeping them long-term.

Earning ad-revenue through displaying ads is also quite a common way of earning the required upkeep. Be aware, that most *legal* ad platforms might not cooperate with your site and you will likely have to rely on shady or adult-targetting ads, which may not be very ideal. Also, take care to not annoy your users with frequent or overintrusive ads.
