## Is torrenting illegal?

Torrenting itself isn't illegal. However, sharing and downloading copyrighted material may be illegal depending on your local laws. Copyright organizations can send takedown notices to the internet service provider (ISP) of the file transfer participants and start lawsuits against them for infringement.

## Where can I find anime torrents?

- [Nyaa](https://nyaa.si)

- [AniDex](https://anidex.info/)

- [TokyoTosho](https://www.tokyotosho.info/?cat=1)

## What group should I get releases from?

P2P groups `SubsPlease` and `Erai-raws` and scene groups `SUGOI` and `SENPAI` upload currently airing anime. `HorribleSubs` formerly uploaded airing anime but stopped releasing in October 2020.

However, they're not the best source for older anime or anime that has been released to Blu-ray. For the absolute best video quality or the best fansubs, try searching for the releases mentioned in:

- [SeaSmoke's Anime Index](https://releases.moe)


- [A Certain Fansubber's Index](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PJYwhjzLNPXV2X1np-S4rdZE4fb7pxp-QbHY1O0jH6Q/htmlview)

Check out the [sourcing guide](/guides/sourcing) for more detailed information on finding the best release for any particular anime.

## What does it mean for a torrent to be "stalled"?

The files you download from torrents are downloaded from [**seeders**](/guides/torrenting), who have already finished downloading the files and are uploading to leechers/peers, who may also upload to each other. In case there aren't enough seeders, or if you are unable to [connect](/guides/torrenting#connectability) to a seeder, you will be unable to download 100% of a torrent. 

This may also be because the initial seeder (the uploader) hasn't uploaded the entirety of the file to the **swarm** yet. Usually, you can wait and you should eventually connect to a seeder, but in case there are no seeders, you can ask someone who has the file to re-seed it so that you can download it. You can also try **reannouncing** to the [tracker](/guides/torrenting#glossary) (manually requesting the tracker for a refresh on peers and seeders) to try and get more seeders.

## What do I do if some files are corrupt/unplayable?

There is a **recheck** option in most torrent clients. This will recheck the hashes of the pieces and will re-download the missing or corrupted pieces, and fix the files. However, if there are no seeders or only partial seeders, you will be unable to download those pieces.
