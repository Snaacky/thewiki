## Reddit Moderation

### Rules

&nbsp;

#### Rule 1: No sourcing or linking to copyrighted material

> Attempting to source or linking to copyrighted material is not allowed and also violates Reddit's [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy).

The [reddit content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) explicitly states:

> **Rule 7:**
	Keep it legal, and avoid posting illegal content or soliciting or facilitating [illegal or prohibited transactions](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/reddits-policy-against-transactions).
  
This means that failing to abide the Reddit rules will put us on thin ice with a high possibility of getting the subreddit removed. To ensure the survival of our subreddit long-term, we cannot take a risk allowing this sort of content.

&nbsp;

#### Rule 2: No frequently posted topics

> Frequently posted topics will be removed at moderator discretion to reduce repetition. This includes certain questions and memes. Before posting, please do a quick search to see if another user has asked or shared something similar.

No one wants to visit a subreddit with questions that are asked over and over again, especially when these can be easily answered by doing a quick homework using our resources such as the index and wiki.

&nbsp;

#### Rule 3: No piracy app/site support submissions

> Tech support submissions for piracy websites and apps are not allowed on our subreddit. Users should seek support from the respective service for their issues.

The subreddit receives these type of submissions at a high frequency daily and it clutters the subreddit home page. Most of the time, they are better suited to their respective community. 

Posts regarding mpv, Plex, Sonarr, or other services and programs that are are still relevant to the community, but are not piracy apps/sites are allowed.

If any app/site support is needed, feel free to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/piracy) and ask for help in the [`#questions_and_help`](https://discord.com/channels/622243127435984927/623172747056513026) channel.


&nbsp;

#### Rule 4: No off-topic discussion

> Submissions must be related to Chinese, Japanese, and Korean media piracy, including but not limited to anime, manga, manhwa, light novels, visual novels, and hentai.

Any posts about the aforementioned topics that are not related to piracy will be removed. Keep general discussion about them in their respective communities. Also, all posts specific to Western piracy will removed.

&nbsp;

#### Rule 5: No attacks or witchhunts

> Do not personally attack other users. Do not attempt to incite a witchhunt against other users or services. Constructive criticism is allowed, but ranting will be removed.

Toxic users trying to pick up fights on the internet will not be tolerated under any circumstances. Furthermore, it reflects poorly upon the community as a whole, while also alienating other users who wants a civil, informative discussion.

&nbsp;

#### Rule 6: No advertising without permission

> Self-promotional content must receive prior approval. Suspected astroturfing may result in a service blacklist. Advertisements are limited to one post a month and are only for substantial updates. FOSS projects are exempt.

Any promotional activities must be approved by our admins. Due to the large amount of malicious or straight up awful services existing on the internet, we cannot afford to let our users being misinformed and fall into the hands of the devil.

There is a fine line between user recommendations on a service and promotional activity. 
&nbsp;

#### Rule 7: No buying, selling, trading, or giveaways

> Buying, selling, and trading any items or services is not allowed. Invites for private communities cannot be asked for, offered, or shared. Giveaways must receive prior approval.

The aforementioned actions may lead to both the inviter and the invitee being banned from the service in question and are often frowned upon in most private communities, due to the inviter bearing responsibility for the invitee. This is a bannable offense and we have absolutely zero tolerance on users who are trying to make a profit from it.

&nbsp;

### Bans


Bans are handed out to people with disruptive behaviors in the community. Banned users will be unable to make any submissions, but are still able to see other submisions. There are two types of ban:

- **Temporary**: Users are reinstated after the stipulated period, usually for minor offenses.

- **Permanent**: Continual violation of any rules, advertising without permission, or harassing the moderation team will be a ground for a permanent ban.

Users may be unbanned with a reasonable appeal to the moderation team and it depends on the severity of the offense they commited. There may be some circumstances which are not covered here.

&nbsp;

### Distinguished, Stickied, and Pinned Posts

Distinguished comments and/or posts speak officially from the perspective of the moderation team. Undistinguished comments and/or posts by anyone on the moderation team are **never** official or formal statements, and they do not speak from the perspective of the whole team. Keeping a professional image is crucial.

Stickied comments are pinned to the top of a post. When used in along with a distinguish, it serves as a source of information to users who are commenting.

Pinned posts stay on top of the front page regardless of any trending posts for an undetermined amount of time. Pinned posts usually pertain to any important announcements, news, or meta discussions that are relevant at the time of the post. Only up to two pinned posts are allowed due to Reddit restrictions.

&nbsp;

## FAQ

### Can I link to piracy sites, torrents, or direct download links?

All subreddits are governed by the [Reddit Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) which means we have to be careful with what we allow in order to keep our subreddit from being shutdown. 

* You may reference sites by name with or without the top level domain (many sites have a similar name with a different TLD), but we ask you do not link to them. 

* You may reference torrents by their ID (the string of numbers at the end of the URL) but we ask you do not link them. 

* We ask you refrain from linking direct download (Drive, Mega, OneDrive, etc.) links on our subreddit.  

Attempting to bypass our link filters will result in a ban.

### What are those strings of numbers I keep seeing?

Torrent releases from Nyaa are referenced by their ID in a similar vein to nHentai releases, think 177013 for example. You can find the torrent's release ID at the end of the page's URL. 

They are used liked this: `nyaa.si/view/177013`
