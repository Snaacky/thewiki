# FAQ

## Can I link to piracy sites, torrents, or direct download links?

All subreddits are governed by the [Reddit Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) which means we have to be careful with what we allow in order to keep our subreddit from being shutdown. 

* You may reference sites by name with or without the top level domain (many sites have a similar name with a different TLD), but we ask you do not link to them. 

* You may reference torrents by their ID (the string of numbers at the end of the URL) but we ask you do not link them. 

* We ask you refrain from linking direct download (Drive, Mega, OneDrive, etc.) links on our subreddit.  

Attempting to bypass our link filters will result in a ban.

## What are those strings of numbers I keep seeing?

Torrent releases are referenced by their ID in a similar vein to nHentai releases, think 177013 for example. You can find the torrent's release ID at the end of the page's URL. 

## Where can I find X? What app has X? What's the best X?
If you're looking for a streaming site or app, check out [the index](https://theindex.moe/). If you're looking for a torrent, check Nyaa. These types of posts violate our subreddit rules and will be removed. If you still can't find the answer you're looking for, or looking for a service with some specific feature, these questions are allowed in [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/snackbox).

## Is X illegal?

If you're accessing or downloading content from unauthorized sources, regardless of the method of delivery, you're more than likely engaging in copyright infringement.

Utilizing the BitTorrent protocol and peer-to-peer (P2P) networks is not inherently illegal.

The legality of accessing or downloading copyright infringing material depends on your local laws but is illegal under most jurisdictions. 

## I'm having issues with X, help?

Seek help in the proper channels of the respective service (Discord, forums, etc.). We are not the appropriate platform for these types of submissions. These types of submissions violate our subreddit rules and will be removed.

This also applies to feature suggestion posts for apps and services.

## How large should a typical high quality 1080p anime episode be?

For airing anime ripped from official streams, the size is around 1.4GB. Mini encodes or the versions on streaming sites are encoded from this and are in the range of 200-400 MB. None of those can be called "high quality". A good encode using the blu-ray as a source is usually between 1 and 2 GB, and as high as 4-5 GB where it's needed. Sometimes the best release could be a remux at about ~6GB per episode.

Size can be used to judge web sources, but it's not the best measure of quality for BDRips. Even though the raw BDMV is larger, a good encode will give you the better experience. Check out [Quality](/en/guides/quality) for more.

## Where can I download smaller sized episodes?

For those low on data or storage, HEVC mini encodes on nyaa are the best option. In terms of quality, they'll be equal to or often better than streaming sites. Simply search `anime name hevc` in the category `Anime - English Translated` on nyaa and sort by seeds. Some release groups doing these are - Judas, Akihito, Ember, DB, and Cleo.

## Where can I find subbed/dubbed anime?

Streaming sites usually have (dub) in the title to differentiate dubs, the default version without a (dub) tag is the subbed one.

Nyaa and torrents have something called dual audio where the mkv files include both Japanese and English audio with accompanying subtitle tracks. All the dubs you'll find on nyaa are dual audio. If it doesn't say dual audio then it's sub only.

## Where can I download subtitles separately?

[Animetosho](https://animetosho.org/) has subtitles and attachments for most torrents on nyaa. They can be downloaded by clicking the `all attachments` button at the bottom of any page. Remember that the included fonts are important for any fansub to display correctly. They can be installed, placed in the font directory for your player or muxed into the mkv.

## How can I add/remove subtitles or audio?

[MKVToolNix](https://mkvtoolnix.download/) is the tool for all kinds of muxing, simply drag and drop the files and you'll be able to select the streams to keep in the final output. This is a lossless process different from encoding and takes only a few seconds.

## Where do unofficial streaming sites get their streams from?

They get them from release groups like Erai-raws or Subsplease who rip official streams from Crunchyroll, Funimation, VRV etc. Some sites may do their own rips, and many re-encode these streams to get a smaller size. For older anime which have a BD release, some sites may switch to that as a source for better quality.

Note that these "rips" are not screen captures, they're unaltered WEB-DLs. You can find them on nyaa or release group sites.

## Why are the subtitles for this anime on streaming site X different from site Y or torrent Z?

It depends on which source is used by different streaming sites. The most common one is subtitles from the official stream. Fansubbers often take this as a base and improve upon it by adding effects, translating signs and making edits. Some sites may be using these fansubs as a source. For more information -  [Sourcing - Fansubs.](/en/guides/sourcing#fansubs)

## How long will I have to wait for the newest anime episode to be available on streaming sites and torrents?

For a direct rip from Crunchyroll/Funimation, expect it to be less than 5 minutes for torrents and 20 minutes to 1 hour for streaming sites. High quality fansubs can take up to a few days depending on the group doing it.

## Website X is blocked in my country/by my ISP, how do I bypass it?

Not every block is implemented the same, so the only way to figure out is by trial and error.

- If it's a DNS-based block, you may have success by simply changing your DNS servers to ones that aren't controlled by your ISP.


- If it's a deep packet inspection (DPI) block, you may have some success with DPI circumvention tools such as [GoodbyeDPI](https://github.com/ValdikSS/GoodbyeDPI) or [PowerTunnel](https://github.com/krlvm/PowerTunnel-Android).


- Otherwise, a VPN with servers in a country without censorship blocks will usually work. [Refer to our VPN FAQ section for more information](/en/faq/vpn).

## Why is there no OP/ED playing for a particular anime on a streaming site?

Streaming sites use torrent releases as a source. Sometimes they get a release with ordered chapters/linked mkvs. Since these are meant to be downloaded, the op/ed come as a separate file and automatically play inside each episode at the correct time. This can be fixed by combining them back into a single file, but streaming sites will rarely make the effort. If you want the complete experience with OP/EDs, check out the [ordered chapters section here](/en/guides/sourcing) for more information about them and ways to fix it

# Streaming

## **Which official streaming sites are available for me?**

This depends on which region you are in due to licensing. [/r/anime offers an extensive list on their wiki of what streaming services are available for which regions](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/legal_streams).

## **What are the most popular unofficial streaming sites?**

In January 2022, we asked the community to vote for their favorite websites and here are the results:
https://www.reddit.com/r/animepiracy/comments/1041ke4/best_anime_sites_of_2022_are/

## **Which websites offer subs/dubs, downloads, 320/480/720/1080p, or are ad-free?**

Please refer to our [index](https://theindex.moe/). We have a comprehensive list of over 200+ sites and their features.

Use uBlock Origin (recommended) or AdGuard AdBlock. Both are browser extensions that can be found on the plugin store of Google Chrome and Firefox.

## **Is {website}/{app} safe? Can it harm my PC/phone/tablet?**

You're always taking a gamble when using piracy sites or sideloading apps on your phone. Do your research about the site/app you're using.

## **Where can I stream 4K/BD quality anime?**

Nowhere. Only a handful of anime has been produced at 4K and no unofficial streaming site would be capable of bearing the load of streaming 4K/BD quality anime. If you're interested in this type of content, you will have to torrent it.

## **Are there any apps for Android and iOS?**

Please check out our subreddit's [index](https://theindex.moe/) in the 'Application' section for a list of apps on various platforms.

## Is torrenting illegal?

Torrenting itself isn't illegal. However, sharing and downloading copyrighted material may be illegal depending on your local laws. Copyright organizations can send takedown notices to the internet service provider (ISP) of the file transfer participants and start lawsuits against them for infringement.

# VPN 

## What is a VPN?

A virtual private network (VPN) is a service that gives you online privacy by masking your IP address so that all of your online actions are virtually untraceable unless your VPN provider keeps logs - we highly recommend you to stay away from such providers.

## What VPNs are safe for use?

The only VPNs that should be considered safe are paid VPNs that claim that they do not retain logs. Make sure to do your research while picking a VPN provider. /r/VPN has a [VPN comparison table](https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/m736zt/vpn_comparison_table/), which is an excellent resource to start with. On top of a VPN with great speed without retaining any logs, you should also double check to see whether if the VPN in question supports crucial features such as port forwarding, split tunneling, or kill switch - such as Mullvad, TorGuard, or Private Internet Access (PIA).

TorrentFreak's [Which VPN Providers Really Take Privacy Seriously in 2021?](https://torrentfreak.com/best-vpn-anonymous-no-logging/) can also be used as a point of reference for paid VPNs feature comparison.

> [That One Privacy Site](https://thatoneprivacysite.net/) was sold to a third party and is no longer a trustworthy source for VPN comparison. {.is-info}

> Take the top Google search results with a grain of salt - those reviews are often times have affiliations with the service per se. {.is-warning}

## Do I need to use a VPN for torrenting?

Using a VPN for piracy purposes are always a good practice - hence, it is advised. Legal entities acting on behalf of copyright holders have been known to send DMCA letters to the ISP of IP addresses found in P2P network swarms. 

## Do I need a VPN for streaming or direct download link (DDL)?

Using VPN for streaming and DDL is usually not necessary unless you are coming from a place that blocks such sites. It is also unlikely you will ever receive a DMCA (or equivalent) notice for streaming or from DDL.

Please note that there are a few streaming sites (both official and non-official) that do not allow VPN use on their services.

## Are there any good free VPNs?

Gambling with free VPNs is highly discouraged. They often come with a lot of risks and drawbacks:

- Your internet traffic is likely logged (and can also be potentially sold to unknown third parties for personal gain), which comes with the possibility of receiving a DMCA (or equivalent) notice.
- Very limited bandwitdth (upload/download speed).
- Often comes with a severe data cap.
- Unstable connection.
- Might not even allow torrent traffic.

 Buying a long-term VPN subscription can be as cheap as $3/month, so please help yourself. 

## Is it safe to use a cracked/modded VPN?

Absolutely not. The cracked/modded VPN might be injected with foreign scripts (a disguised malware) that can modify or leak your personal information or data without consent.

## Can I get a DMCA (or equivalent) notice for using a VPN?

If you are using a paid VPN without logs, no. If you are using a free VPN or a VPN that retains logs, it is possible for your VPN provider to receive a DMCA (or equivalent) notice and forward it to your ISP.
