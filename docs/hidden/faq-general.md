# General FAQ

## Where can I find X? What app has X? What's the best X?
If you're looking for a streaming site or app, check out [TheIndex](https://theindex.moe). If you're looking for a torrent, check Nyaa. These types of posts violate our subreddit rules and will be removed. If you still can't find the answer you're looking for, or looking for a service with some specific feature, these questions are allowed in [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/theindex).

## Is X illegal?

If you're accessing or downloading content from unauthorized sources, regardless of the method of delivery, you're more than likely engaging in copyright infringement.

Utilizing the BitTorrent protocol and peer-to-peer (P2P) networks is not inherently illegal.

The legality of accessing or downloading copyright infringing material depends on your local laws but is illegal under most jurisdictions. 

## I'm having issues with X, help?

Seek help in the proper channels of the respective service (Discord, forums, etc.). We are not the appropriate platform for these types of submissions. These types of submissions violate our subreddit rules and will be removed.

This also applies to feature suggestion posts for apps and services.

## How large should a typical high quality 1080p anime episode be?

For airing anime ripped from official streams, the size is always 1.3-1.4 GB. Mini encodes or the versions on streaming sites are encoded from this and are in the range of 200-400 MB. None of those can be called "high quality". A good encode using the blu-ray as a source is usually between 1 and 2 GB, and as high as 4-5 GB where it's needed. 

Size can be used to judge web sources, but it's not the best measure of quality for BDRips. Even though the raw BDMV is larger, a good encode will give you the better experience. Check out [Sourcing - Quality](/en/guides/sourcing#quality) for more.

## Where can I download smaller sized episodes?

For those low on data or storage, HEVC mini encodes on nyaa are the best option. In terms of quality, they'll be equal to or often better than streaming sites. Simply search `anime name hevc` in the category `Anime - English Translated` on nyaa and sort by seeds. The most common release groups doing these are - Judas, Akihito, Ember, DB, and Cleo.

## Where can I find subbed/dubbed anime?

Streaming sites usually have (dub) in the title to differentiate dubs, the default version without a (dub) tag is the subbed one.

Nyaa and torrents have something called dual audio where the mkv files include both japanese and english audio with accompanying subtitle tracks. All the dubs you'll find on nyaa are dual audio. If it doesn't say dual audio then it's sub only.

## Where can I download subtitles separately?

[Animetosho](https://animetosho.org/) has subtitles and attachments for most torrents on nyaa. They can be downloaded by clicking the `all attachments` button at the bottom of any page. Remember that the included fonts are important for any fansub to display correctly. They can be installed, placed in the font directory for your player or muxed into the mkv.

## How can I add/remove subtitles or audio?

[Mkvtoolnix](https://mkvtoolnix.download/) is the tool for all kinds of muxing, simply drag and drop the files and you'll be able to select the streams to keep in the final output. This is a lossless process different from encoding and takes only a few seconds. Batch muxing and more - [Guides - Muxing.](/en/guides/sourcing#muxing)

## Where do unofficial streaming sites get their streams from?

They get them from release groups like Erai-raws or Subsplease who rip official streams from Crunchyroll, Funimation, VRV etc. Some sites may do their own rips, and many re-encode these streams to get a smaller size. For older anime which have a BD release, some sites may switch to that as a source for better quality.

Note that these "rips" are not screen captures, they're unaltered WEB-DLs. You can find them on nyaa or release group sites.

## Why are the subtitles for this anime on streaming site X different from site Y or torrent Z?

It depends on which source is used by different streaming sites. The most common one is subtitles from the official stream. Fansubbers often take this as a base and improve upon it by adding effects, translating signs and making edits. Some sites may be using these fansubs as a source. For more information -  [Sourcing - Fansubs.](/en/guides/sourcing#fansubs)

## How long will I have to wait for the newest anime episode to be available on streaming sites and torrents?

For a direct rip from Crunchyroll/Funimation, expect it to be less than 5 minutes for torrents and 20 minutes to 1 hour for streaming sites. High quality fansubs can take up to a few days depending on the group doing it.

## Website X is blocked in my country/by my ISP, how do I bypass it?

Not every block is implemented the same, so the only way to figure out is by trial and error.

- If it's a DNS-based block, you may have success by simply changing your DNS servers to ones that aren't controlled by your ISP.


- If it's a deep packet inspection (DPI) block, you may have some success with DPI circumvention tools such as [GoodbyeDPI](https://github.com/ValdikSS/GoodbyeDPI) or [PowerTunnel](https://github.com/krlvm/PowerTunnel-Android).


- Otherwise, a VPN with servers in a country without censorship blocks will usually work. [Refer to our VPN FAQ section for more information](/en/faq/vpn).

## Why is there no OP/ED playing for a particular anime on a streaming site?

Streaming sites use torrent releases as a source. Sometimes they get a release with ordered chapters/linked mkvs. Since these are meant to be downloaded, the op/ed come as a separate file and automatically play inside each episode at the correct time. This can be fixed by combining them back into a single file, but streaming sites will rarely make the effort. If you want the complete experience with OP/EDs, check out the [ordered chapters section here](/en/guides/sourcing) for more information about them and ways to fix it
