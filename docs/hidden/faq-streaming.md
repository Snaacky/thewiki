# Streaming FAQ

## **Which official streaming sites are available for me?**

This depends on which region you are in due to licensing. [/r/anime offers an extensive list on their wiki of what streaming services are available for which regions](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/legal_streams).

## **Which websites offer subs/dubs, downloads, 320/480/720/1080p, or are ad-free?**

Please refer to [TheIndex](https://theindex.moe/). We have a comprehensive list of over 200+ sites and their features.

## **I really like {website} but it reeks of ads. How do I get rid of them?**

Use uBlock Origin (recommended) or AdGuard AdBlock. Both are browser extensions that can be found on the plugin store of Google Chrome and Firefox.

## **Is {website} safe? Can it harm my PC?**

You're always taking a gamble when using sites. Do your research about the site you're using.

## **Where can I stream 4K/BD quality anime?**

Nowhere. Only a handful of anime has been produced at 4K and no unofficial streaming site would be capable of bearing the load of streaming 4K/BD quality anime. If you're interested in this type of content, you will have to torrent it.

## **Are there any apps for Android and iOS?**

Please refer to [TheIndex](https://theindex.moe/) in the 'Application' section for a list of apps on various platforms.

## **Is {app} trustworthy? Can it harm my phone/tablet?**

You’re always taking a gamble when sideloading apps on your phone. Do your research about the app you're installing.

## **How do I request my site to be put on the [index](https://theindex.moe/)?**
 
 You can do so by go to [our Discord](https://discord.gg/theindex) and fill in the form in the `#index-wiki` channel.
 
## **Site X is dead, site Y is no longer ad-free but the index says otherwise. How do I suggest an edit?**
 
 Same process applies, go to the `#index-wiki` channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/theindex) and leave us a message.
