# Trial Mod Guide

&nbsp;

If you're reading this, congratulations! You have beaten the odds and have been accepted into the moderation team of /r/animepiracy! This guide will serve as a point of reference on what to do as a Trial Mod, so let's hop right in!

&nbsp;

## Introduction

/r/animepiracy is a community devoted to the discussions "weeb media" piracy (primarily anime), available on both [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/AnimePiracy) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/piracy). The subreddit is our primary base of operations, while any communication both among the staffs and members are dedicated to the Discord server.

As a moderator, these are the Discord channels that will require extra attention:

- [`#announcements`](https://discord.com/channels/622243127435984927/767725130695573505) : Important announcements pertaining to the subreddit and discord.

- [`#moderation`](https://discord.com/channels/622243127435984927/624253391563915264) : Moderation topics pertaining to both the subreddit and the discord are discussed here. If you have any queries regarding mod actions, this is the place.

- [`#reddit-posts`](https://discord.com/channels/622243127435984927/623809718011297792) : New posts from the subreddit will show up here to avoid the hassle of having to constantly refreshing the home page or checking out the mod queue.

&nbsp;

## Reddit Moderation

> If you have any concerns or questions regarding moderation issues, ask in the `#moderation` channel on Discord prior to taking an action. It saves us valuable time to double check, resolving the miscommunications, and reverse the damage. {.is-info}

Reddit submissions come in two forms: post and comments. Of these, posts are easier to moderate due to their relatively low volume, unlike comments.

Moderation activities mostly take place on:
- [Home Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/animepiracy): This is the face of the subreddit and is what an average user sees when they walk in.

- [Modqueue](https://www.reddit.com/r/animepiracy/about/modqueue): This is where the posts and comments that were caught by our filter or were reported by users fall into. 

- [Modmail](https://mod.reddit.com/mail/all): This is our mean of communication to users about various issues, namely post/comment removal concerns, ban appeals, or promotional activity approvals.

&nbsp;

### Modqueue

The modqueue is where the potentially rule breaking submissions reported by users or flagged by AutoModerator shows up. Most of the time, you only need to either approve or remove them. Submissions with a yellow highlight are the ones reported by users and AutoModerator.

> "Approve" is an action that undoes a removal and/or prevents the filter from automatically removing it as spam. {.is-info}

Do remember to check the context of the submission prior to making any moderator actions. At times, there are false positives from the filter, or some users mistakenly report some submissions that do not violate any rules.

&nbsp;

### Re-flairing

Every post has a 'flair' to cagetorize its topic. When a post that is not flaired appropriately, make sure to correct it.

| Flair | Usage |
|:-----:|:-----:|
|Question| For any trivial questions or concerns that are not significant enough to be considered a discussion.|
|Discussion| Topics to be discussed.|
|Solved| For any posts with a 'Question' flair that has been answered.|
|Update| For site staffs and developers whose approved sites or apps receiving a major content or feature update.|
|News| Important news pertaining to the anime piracy community, such as private trackers global freeleech events, open registrations, or streaming sites end of service notice.|
|Meta| Discussions pertaining to the latest events of the subreddit.|
|Meme| Any text or image based fluff posts solely for entertainment purpose.|
|Developer Post| For approved site staffs and developers to advertise their services.|
|Release| For approved repackers or release groups to announce new releases.|
|Mod Post| Used for official subreddit announcements from the moderation team.|
|Removed/Rule X (Title)| Post removal flairs that are to be used when posts are removed.|
|Wait for Blu-Ray| For posts that are seeking for information about the Blu-ray release of an anime. Any related posts will be removed and linked to the original one with this flair.|

&nbsp;

### Modmail
>  While you may read modmail and bring them to the attention of senior staffs, do **not** respond until you are given permission by them. {.is-warning}

> Due to the sensitive nature of modmail, please refrain from screenshotting, publically posting, or leaking them. You may link to them on the Discord, however, since only moderators are able to access it. {.is-warning}

Since the modmail is our public relations area with site staffs, they requires a certain degree of experience to handle. Most of the time, only admins are authorized to reply to such topics. More trivial matters related to user concerns regarding ban appeals and clarifications are more lax and can be handled by regular staffs.

&nbsp;

## Discord Moderation

While Discord moderating is optional, trial staffs are also given moderation permissions on the Discord. However, in a majority of cases, our dedicated Discord Moderators will handle it. Some actions you may perform are:

- Removals: Delete messages that violate the rules.

- Warning:
	- Verbal: Users are warned directly by a moderator, does not go on record.
  - Bot: Direct messages (DM) the user with the warning and records it.
  
- Mute: Takes away the messaging permissions of a user for a specified duration (to be done via the bot) due to rule violations.

- Kick: Removes a user from the server, however, they may still re-join with an invite link.

- Ban: Removes a user from the server, and blacklists them. They will be unable to re-join even with an invite link.

> Do exercise due discretion and use bans only in the gravest of circumstances or when a senior staff approves it.  {.is-warning}

> Our moderation bot (Chiya) is currently under development and will be done soon. {.is-info}

&nbsp;

## Removal Reasons

> Don't forget to flair and add removal reason (pre when removing a submission. {.is-info}

> Only post removals require a removal reason comment. If a post is re-approved by you, do make sure to remove the removal reason comment. {.is-info}

&nbsp;

### Rule 1: No "where can I find?" submissions

> All content sourcing and "where can I find?" style submissions will be removed.

We used to have a pinned WCIF thread dedicated to this sort of question due to the high influx of these posts we received daily. Over time, it proved to be not an effective way to solve the problem at its root as explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/animepiracy/comments/kt35cu/so_long_wcif_and_thanks_for_all_the_fish/) by our head moderator /u/Snaacky.

&nbsp;

### Rule 2: No duplicate posts

> Topics that have been recently discussed, are frequently discussed, or that can be answered by reading the index will be removed.

No one wants to visit a subreddit with questions that are asked over and over again, especially when these can be easily answered by doing a quick homework using our resources such as the index and wiki. If possible, link the post to the relevant place where the question was answered recently.

&nbsp;

### Rule 3: No linking to copyrighted materials

> Direct links to streams, torrents, downloads, and file hosting services will be removed.

The [reddit content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) explicitly states:

  > **Rule 7:**
  > Keep it legal, and avoid posting illegal content or soliciting or facilitating [illegal or prohibited transactions](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/reddits-policy-against-transactions).
  
This means that failing to abide the Reddit rules will put us on thin ice with a high possibility of getting the subreddit removed. To ensure the survival of our subreddit long-term, we cannot take a risk allowing this sort of content.

&nbsp;

### Rule 4: No app/site tech support posts

> Submissions about bans, buffering, temporary downtime, or any other issue related to unofficial services will be removed.

Similar to rule 2, we receive this type of submissions at a high frequency daily and it clutters the subreddit home page. Most of the time, they are better suited to their respective community. However, if possible, guide them to our Discord server instead.

&nbsp;

### Rule 5: No misinformation

> Submissions that contain false claims or encourage fear mongering will be removed.

- Misinforming or fear mongering submissions include:
	- Submissions that are speculative and may raise unnecessary fear and suspicion.
  - Submissions that contain wrong information or advice which may end up being malicious or harmful to a reader.
  
No justification should be allowed on misinformation to stir up unnecessary drama within our users. These takes a lot of time and effort to mitigate the collateral damage. However, if a user genuinely appears to be misinformed, please let them know and correct them. 

&nbsp;

### Rule 6: No advertising without permission

> Advertisements and self-promotion for apps, services, websites, etc., must be approved by the mod team beforehand. Requests for approval can be sent in via modmail.

Any promotional activities must be approved by our admins. Due to the large amount of malicious or straight up awful services existing on the internet, we cannot afford to let our users being misinformed and fall into the hands of the devil.

There is a fine line between user recommendations on a service and promotional activity. Please check the context carefully before issuing any moderator actions.

&nbsp;

### Rule 7: No personal attacks or witchhunts

> Submissions encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed.

Toxic users trying to pick up fights on the internet should never be tolerated under any circumstances. Furthermore, it reflects poorly upon the moderation team and the community as a whole, while also alienate other users who wants a civil, informative discussion.

&nbsp;

### Rule 8: Submissions must be related to piracy of "weeb" media

> Submissions must be related to the piracy of media surrounding "weeb" culture such as anime, manga, light novels, visual novels, hentai, and games.

Any unrelated submissions are considered as spam and should be posted on their respective community.

&nbsp;

### Rule 9: Submissions must be in discernible English

> Submissions must be in clear and discernible English. We are an English-speaking community and cannot properly moderate non-English submissions.

This is an effort to reduce low quality submissions. Furthermore, moderating non-English submissions takes significantly higher amount of efforts. We cannot afford to Google Translate every single comments, scratch our head to figure out the current context to make sure they are not breaking any rules.

&nbsp;

### Rule 10: No invite requests or offers

> Do not offer or request, whether obvious or implied, invites to team drives, trackers, forums, or any other communities.

The aforementioned actions may lead to both the inviter and the invitee being banned from the service in question and are often frowned upon in most private communities, due to the inviter bearing responsibility for the invitee. This is a bannable offense and we have absolutely zero tolerance on users who are trying to make a profit from it.

&nbsp;

## Ban

> Remove the submission in question with the approriate reason, link it to the ban reason and make a moderation note for future references. {.is-info}

Bans are handed out to people with disruptive behaviors in the community. Banned users will be unable to make any submissions, but they can still see other submissions. There are two types of ban:

- Temporary: Users are reinstated after the stipulated period, usually for minor offenses such as rule 7 or rule 10.

- Permanent: Continual violation of any rules, advertising without permission, or harassing the moderation team will be a ground for a permanent ban.

Users may be unbanned with a reasonable appeal to the moderation team and it depends on the severity of the offense they commited. There may be some circumstances which are not covered here. When in doubt, please consult with the moderation team prior to taking any actions.

&nbsp;

## Distinguishing, Sticky, and Pinning

!!!warning Warning
Do not pin or remove any currently pinned post until permitted by the senior staffs.
!!!
Distiguishing your comments and/or posts when removing contents or speaking officially from the perspective of the moderation team is encouraged. Otherwise, **never** distinguish when you are casually joining in a discussion with other users. Keeping a professional image is crucial.

Stickying a comment is to pin your comment to the top of a post. When used in along with a distinguish, it serves as a source of information to users who are commenting.

Pinning is to force a post to stay on top of the front page regardless of any trending posts for an undetermined amount of time. Only up to two pinned posts are allowed due to Reddit restrictions.

&nbsp;

## Staff Tiers

In r/AnimePiracy, there have 3 tiers of staff. They are:

- Trial Staff: Newly recruited staff members that are learning the ropes when it comes to moderation.

- Full Staff: Staffs that have 'passed' their trial phase successfully. (If you have any queries, feel free to ask these people, they're super nice!).

- Administrator: Overseers of the moderation team. They are the ones who recruit trials, approve important changes, and administrate the Discord server and the subreddit.

!!!
There are certain staffs recognised as "Senior Staff" among the "Full Staff", who will be in charge when administrators are unavailable to take decisions on urgent matters. !!!
 
In addition, there are other staffs:

- Developers: Developers that are working on Chiya (the moderation bot), the index/wiki frontend or backend.

- Index Editor: Content curators of the index to make sure the information is always up-to-date.

- Wiki Editors: Content curators of the wiki and FAQ section.
