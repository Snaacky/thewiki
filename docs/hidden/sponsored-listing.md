# Sponsored Listing


## What is a sponsored listing?

A sponsored listing is a paid advertisement featured on https://theindex.moe.


## How much do sponsored listings cost?

A sponsored listing is $75 USD for a 30 day period.

## Can we negotiate prices?

Unfortunately, our price is firm and we're unwilling to negotiate prices. 

We offer the definitive resource for users looking for new services to try out. Our prices are the absolute lowest available for the kind of targeted advertising we provide. You simply will not find a better deal on the market.

## What does a sponsored listing look like?

Your sponsored listing will be put up in three places, on the home page of the index for maximum traffic potential, at the top of the library overview (category) for your service, and at the top of any collections that your service is in (sub-categories).

Home page:

## How much traffic does the index receive per month?

The index receives anywhere from 160,000 to 300,000 unique visitors depending on the month.


## What payment methods are supported?

We only accept cryptocurrency to avoid potential abuse. We prefer Bitcoin and Litecoin but please inquire about other crypto. We ask that you attempt to refrain from cryptocurrencies currently experiencing high volatility and transaction fees.


## How many sponsored listings are allowed at one time?

We currently allow up to 4 sponsored listings per library (i.e anime, manga, light novels, hentai, etc.).

## Do sponsored listings show on other tabs (i.e anime site on the manga tab)? 

No, while all sponsored listings will appear on the home page, they will only show in their relevant library while browsing the site. Anime services will only appear under the anime library, manga services will only appear under the manga library, and so on.

## Can I decide the text on the sponsored listing?

Yes, you can write your own description text for the sponsored listing although you are limited up to 3 lines so choose carefully! Your description will be reviewed before being put up, please refrain from misrepresenting your service and its features, as well as avoid slandering other services.

## Can I pre-pay to reserve next months slot in advance?
Yes. Inquire for more details.

## Can I buy multiple slots at once?
Yes. Inquire for more details.

## Can I have the "⭐ Sponsored" badge removed?
No. Sponsored listings are fully transparent.

## Can I have custom HTML or CSS on the listing?
No. It's simply beyond what we're willing to support.

## What URL does the sponsored listing link to?
The sponsored listing must link to your service's home page. Rare exceptions can be made if you intend on pointing it to a subdomain like beta.service.com instead. If you are found to be redirecting your traffic elsewhere, your sponsored listing will be taken down.

## Are there any limits to what I can do with the traffic?
Yes. 

Any abusive actions against our users (crypto mining, using as DDoS bots, attempting browser exploits, etc.) will result in an immediate removal of your sponsored listing, removal from the index, and blacklist from /r/animepiracy and our affiliated communities.

## What is your refund policy?
There is no refunds. All transactions are final.

## What happens if I become blacklisted with a sponsored listing up?

Being blacklisted from our community is a very rare and extremely serious offense. If you are blacklisted from the community while your sponsored listing is live, the sponsored listing will be removed, and you will not be compensated for time lost.
