# How to use the Seadex/Fansubber Index?

- Go to [SeaDex](http://releases.moe/)/[Fansubber Index](http://index.fansubcar.tel) and search for the anime you want to find Best Release/Best Fansub for (In this example i will be using Absolute Duo). In case you are looking for a movie you can switch between TV Series and Movies by clicking on the corresponding buttons at the top left corner.

As You can see the Best Release for **Absolute Duo** is "**KH"**. Now go to [Nyaa](http://nyaa.si) and search for the anime in this format -
`"{Title of Anime}"|"{Alternate Title of Anime}" + {Release Name}"` So for this example it will be `"Absolute Duo + KH"`

And that's how you find Best Release/Best Fansub for the anime you are looking for. Keep in mind Seadex/Fansubber Index doesn't have every anime listed. If you cannot find the anime you are looking for in both of the index. We recommend joining our [Discord](https://discord.gg/snackbox) and asking for help there.
