# Organization

## Media Servers
The setup consists of two parts - the server and the client. A client is simply a media player that will access the content from a server. The server runs on the device which stores your content. Both may be installed on the same system, but they're separate applications. Usually you'd have the server on a computer connected to other devices in your home network and a client installed on all of those devices. All three of the popular ones come with their own client/player as well as support for using kodi as a client (recommended for anime).

## Sonarr
Sonarr is a PVR for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite anime and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available. This is an essential app if you want to use a media server.
## Filebot
FileBot is a tool for renaming and organizing your movies, TV shows and Anime. Match and rename media files against online databases, download artwork and cover images, fetch subtitles, write metadata, and more, but it's better to use this on special occasions when the job can't be done with sonarr.
## Hydrus Network
The hydrus network client is a desktop application written for Anonymous and other internet enthusiasts with large media collections. It organises your files into an internal database and browses them with tags instead of folders, a little like a booru on your desktop.
Hydrus specializes in several aspects:
- Easy to work with large amounts of files
- Use tags for you images to make searching them easier
- Download files from a booru through Hydrus and setup a watcher for new files
- Able to use it as a local booru so you can browse your files from other devices and other networks
[More info on their website](https://hydrusnetwork.github.io/hydrus/)
Useful tools for Hydrus:
[Hydrus companion](https://gitgud.io/prkc/hydrus-companion) - Browser extension for Hydrus to make it easier sourcing and importing images directly into Hydrus.
[Anime boxes](https://www.animebox.es/) - App for Android, iOS and Mac to view your Hydrus Network collections and boorus.
## Storage
### HDD recording methods
- SMR (Shingled Magnetic Recording)
SMR hard disks are a good choice if they are primarily used as pure data storage or if a large hard disk is to be used for a PC on which data is stored. They offer more storage capacity and are more energy efficient than CMR, which makes them ideal for archiving tasks. SMR hard disks are not particularly well suited if the hard disk is to be constantly and permanently doing write operations, as this can lead to a cache overflow leading to sudden low transfer speeds.
- CMR (Conventional Magnetic Recording)
CMR hard disks are a good choice when data is to be stored at high transfer rates or particularly large amounts of data. This includes a large number of activities from music streaming and image processing to use for NAS servers.
For permanent writing activities and the transfer of large amounts of data at high transfer rates, i.e. when the speed of large data transfers is important, CMR hard drives are the better choice.
