# Streaming Sites

!!!warning
Majority of unofficial streaming sites will contain unwanted or annoying pop-ups and ads that may interfere with your experience. *We suggest you use a reliable content blocker such as [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com).*
!!!

## Popular Sites

- [AniWatch](https://aniwatch.to) (previously *Zoro*) - Self-hosted site with quality similar to AniWave while maintaining an extensive library. *One of the only streaming sites with soft subtitles.*
  - *Not to be confused with defunct streaming site [Aniwatch.me](https://aniwatch.me).*
- [AniWave](https://aniwave.to) (previously *9anime*) - Self-hosted site with one of the largest and oldest anime libraries. *Releases are often updated to include fansubs and BD releases for older content.*
- [Gogoanime](https://gogoanime.lu) - Self-hosted site with a vast library. *Majority of scraper sites will source from here.*

See [The Index](https://theindex.moe) for a more comprehensive list of unofficial anime streaming sites.

## Picking a Site

The best way to pick a streaming site is to choose one that suits your needs and preferences. These are some factors that you may want to take into consideration:

### Self-Hosted vs. Scrapers

!!!warning
Beware of fake streaming sites! *These are scrapers with copied interfaces and are oftentimes not reflected of the original site. Always pay attention to the URL of the website.*

*You can always find legitimate sites on [The Index](https://theindex.moe).*
!!!

+++ Self-Hosted

A **self-hosted** site is a streaming site that hosts the content on their own servers.

Typically, self-hosted sites allow for significantly better video quality compared to scrapers or other sites. They also generally pick good BD releases or fansubs for some shows. *However, some self-hosted libraries can be more limited.*

**Examples of self-hosted sites:** [animepahe](https://animepahe.com), [AniWatch](https://aniwatch.to), [AniWave](https://aniwave.to), [Gogoanime](https://gogoanime.lu), [Marin](https://marin.moe)

+++ Scrapers

A **scraper** is a site that grabs content hosted on existing self-hosted sites and uses it for their own site, similar to how manga aggregator sites operate.

This allows for anime libraries equivalent in size to self-hosted ones, without the need for the scraper to host content themselves. Additionally, site owners can implement their own UI or features, which may be preferred over the original site.

Majority of sites will scrape from [Gogoanime](https://gogoanime.lu), a popular self-hosted streaming site.

**Examples of scraper sites:** [AllAnime](https://allanime.to), [Anix](https://anix.to), [Genoanime](https://genoanime.com), [YugenAnime](https://yugenanime.tv)

### Video Quality

While streaming sites will offer worse video quality compared to alternatives such as torrenting, DDL, XDCC, or even legal streaming, *not all streaming sites are made equal.*

### Other Factors

There are a multitude of other factors that may affect your decision in picking a site. Here are some brief recommendations based on some factors that aren't covered in [The Index](https://theindex.moe) and are often not taken into account:

==- Fansubs and BD Releases
[Marin](https://marin.moe) and [animepahe](https://animepahe.com) are very consistent at picking good BD releases with fansubs.

[AniWave](https://aniwave.to) does this too, *but typically less often and with slightly worse release choice.*

==- File Size
[animepahe](https://animepahe.com) has some of the smallest file sizes compared to other streaming sites.

[AniWave's](https://aniwave.to) are also relatively small when compared to sites like [Gogoanime](https://gogoanime.lu) and [Marin](https://marin.moe).

==- Library
[AniWave](https://aniwave.to) and [Gogoanime](https://gogoanime.lu) have some of the largest libraries available.

Additionally, [AniWave](https://aniwave.to) has one of the best libraries when it comes to older and rarer shows.

==- Soft Subs
[AniWatch](https://aniwatch.to) is one of the only streaming sites that use soft subtitles, with the other alternatives being legal streaming sites.

==- UI and Features
Users often care about the UI and site features. *As this is completely subjective, we suggest you visit and try out the collection of sites from [The Index](https://theindex.moe) and find what you like best.*

*Additional factors, like the ability to download, comment, use [MAL-Sync](https://malsync.moe), and more can be identified in [The Index](https://theindex.moe).*
