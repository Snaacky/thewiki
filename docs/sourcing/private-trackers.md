# Private Trackers

Private trackers are BitTorrent trackers that require user registration in order to access and download torrents.

If you're new to torrenting, see the [torrenting guide](/getting-started/torrenting) on how to get started. *Additionally, we suggest you stick to [public trackers](/sourcing/public-trackers), as most shows can be found there without being locked behind user signup.*
