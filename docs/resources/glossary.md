## Codecs

A codec is a software or hardware algorithm that compresses and decompresses audio or video data. There are different types of codecs, each with its own compression algorithms and characteristics. Lossless codecs preserve the original quality of the data during compression and decompression, while lossy codecs achieve higher compression ratios by discarding certain information that is considered less important or perceptually less noticeable. Generally, a codec on it's own does not determine the quality.

### Video Codecs

| ----- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| H.264 | Lossy | Video codec used to compress videos                                           |
| x264  | Lossy | Encoder used to encode videos into H.264                                      |
