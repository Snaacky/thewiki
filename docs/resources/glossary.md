## Codecs

A codec is a software or hardware algorithm that compresses and decompresses audio or video data. There are different types of codecs, each with its own compression algorithms and characteristics. Lossless codecs preserve the original quality of the data during compression and decompression, while lossy codecs achieve higher compression ratios by discarding certain information that is considered less important or perceptually less noticeable. Generally, a codec on it's own does not determine the quality.

| DTS-HD MA          | Proprietary lossless audio codec found in BluRays                                              |
| Dolby TrueHD       | Proprietary lossless audio codec found in BluRays                                              |
| DTS:X              | An extension of DTS-HD MA. Cannot be converted to any other format                             |
| Dolby Atmos        | An extension of Dolby TrueHD. Cannot be converted to any other format                          |
| DTS-HD             | Proprietary Lossy audio codec                                                                  |
| Dolby Digital      | Proprietary Lossy audio codec. Commonly used by official streaming sites                       |
| Dolby Digital Plus | Proprietary Lossy audio codec. Commonly used by official streaming sites                       |
| MP3                | Lossy codec generally used for music, is beaten by newer lossy codecs                          |
| Vorbis             | Outdated lossy codec                                                                           |
| AAC                | Lossy codec used by several official streaming sites                                           |
