| Codec        | A codec is a software or hardware algorithm that compresses and decompresses audio or video data. There are different types of codecs, each with its own compression algorithms and characteristics. Lossless codecs preserve the original quality of the data during compression and decompression, while lossy codecs achieve higher compression ratios by discarding certain information that is considered less important or perceptually less noticeable. Generally, a codec on its own does not determine the quality. |
| Bitrate      | Refers to the amount of data that is processed or transmitted per unit of time. Higher bitrates generally produce higher-quality audio or video, but they also require more storage space and bandwidth for transmission. However, it's worth noting that the relationship between bitrate and quality is not always linear. Factors like the codec, compression algorithm, resolution, and content complexity also play significant roles in determining the perceived quality.                                             |
| Transparency | Transparency is a term used to describe the perceived quality of a lossy file. A lossy file is considered transparent if a human cannot tell the difference between a lossy file and a lossless file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
